# [dkNET](dknet.org) - Decision Trees Code

Based on the [Force11 Decision Trees](https://github.com/force11/Force11-DecisionTrees), developed under [WG3](https://www.force11.org/group/scholarly-commons-working-group/wp3decision-trees).

This repository contains the source code for some decision trees developed for dkNET.

These trees are implemented as [PolicyModels](https://datatagginglibrary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (formerly: DataTags) models.
