# Force11 - Decision Trees Code for WG3

This repository contains the source code for some decision trees developed by [Force11](http://force11.org)'s [WP3: Decision Trees](https://www.force11.org/group/scholarly-commons-working-group/wp3decision-trees).

These trees are implemented as PolicyModels (formerly: DataTags) models:

  * To see them as an interactive interview, visit [our decision tree catalog](http://decision-trees.force11.org/models/).
  * To edit them, download/clone this repository. A PolicyModel/DataTags tutorial is available [here](http://datatagginglibrary.readthedocs.io).
