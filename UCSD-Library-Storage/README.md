# UCSD Library Storage Decision Tree
** THIS IS AN INITIAL, NON-OFFICIAL VERSION. **
** NOT FOR USE (YET) **

This decision tree was created by Ho Jung Yoo and transcribed into PolicyModels by Michael Bar-Sinai.

## Assumptions

* User is a UC San Diego researcher or data steward with data that needs an institutional storage solution.
* The questions apply to the data, not to the user.

## End Goal

* User becomes better informed of the array of storage solutions available at UCSD
* User becomes aware of some of the data stewardship issues that need to be addressed for long-term sustainability of their data
