# Force11-Repository Compliance

__Version 0.2__

This decision tree provides guidance on making data FAIR.  We will have several of these trees, as FAIR encompasses multiple dimensions. This tree covers deposition of data into a repository.  As a hallmark of the scholarly commons is stability, the best way to ensure data is FAIR is to deposit it into a FAIR repository. A trusted data repository will ensure that your data is Findable, by supplying a persistent identifier and standing behind its resolution, and accessible through a standard API.  It will also help ensure that a clear and appropriate license is made available.  For more information on commons compliant repositories, see the  [commons' compliant repositories](http://decision-trees.force11.org/models/repository-compliance/5/intro) decision tree.
