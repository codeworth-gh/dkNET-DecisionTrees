# Can the repository store data containing PHI or any other sensitive information?

The repository needs to have an explicit statement that they're able to handle identified human subject data or other sensitive information that cannot be made public.  Generally, the repository will have documentation about access requirements, e.g., applying to a data access committee to receive permission to use the data.
