# Does the repository focus on a specific domain?

Is there a specific biomedical discipline or subdiscipline this repository is serving such that if you're not working within the discipline you would not be depositing data. E.g. AMPT2D.

Note that __domain__ is different from __data type__ (e.g. genomics).
