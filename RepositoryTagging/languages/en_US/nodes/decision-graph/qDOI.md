# Does the repository support DOI?

How to tell:  Do the public datasets have a DOI? Sometimes a repository will generate a DOI on request so, may need to look into the documentation.

### 📝 Notes 

Add any information on the granularity of the DOI in the Notes Field, e.g., assigns DOIs at the study level but not at the individual experiment level.
