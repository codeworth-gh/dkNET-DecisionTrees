# Force11-Making Data Open

__Version 0.25__

This decision tree provides guidance about how to publish existing data as open data, according to principle [P2. Research and knowledge should be freely available to all who wish to use or reuse it](https://www.force11.org/scholarly-commons/principles). This principle means that data should be open by default and [open by design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3vwpu_ppvBkL1gDSthLG0NYCZA_EUlVbFKdsR4xCg4/edit). However, for existing data, we know that there may be some constraints.  This tree guides you through a series of questions that determines how open your data can be.
