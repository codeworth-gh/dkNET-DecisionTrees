Does the data you wish to share already exist?

The degree to which you can make your data open depends on many factors, including ensuring that the funds are available for publishing the data and that appropriate permissions have been obtained.  If data are already in existence, some of the barriers may not be solvable.  For this reason, we have defined several levels of outcomes [L1-L4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/100Yv2hd9yfrlOscrMiGLqwqW_VWLruxRGoMr68YstNg/edit).  If you are in the planning process of your project, and want to publish open data, consult:  [Making data open by design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3vwpu_ppvBkL1gDSthLG0NYCZA_EUlVbFKdsR4xCg4/edit) to see some of the issues that should be considered up front.
