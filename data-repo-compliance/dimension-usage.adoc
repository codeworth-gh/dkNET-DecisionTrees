# Dimensions in the Repository Evaluation Instrument
Michael Bar-Sinai, Fiona Murphy, Maryann E. Martone

This document describes how the _low-level dimensions (properties and flags)_ in our model affect its _high-level dimensions_. Low-level dimensions describe how an evaluated repository is performing on a narrow aspect, such as its compliance with Creative Commons licenses or the way it allows dataset authors to be associated with https://orcid.org/[ORCID]. High-level dimensions describe wide properties such as "Openness" or "Interoperability". Their value is a summary of values in relevant low-level dimensions.

## How to Read This Document

Below, we list dimensions names on the left, and their coordinates on the right. For each coordinate, we describe what constraints it imposes on the high-level dimensions that summarizes its dimension. As an example, in the following listing we look at the constraints each coordinate in the `Restrictions` dimension imposes on the evaluated repository's coordinate along the `Open` dimension.

[horizontal]
Restrictions::
    * none        => Open in `partially..fully`
    * minimal     => Open is `partially`
    * significant => Open in `not..partially`

Based on the above listing, we see that when an a repository does not restrict the access to its data (i.e. `Restrictions=none`), said repository can be considered _partially open_ or _fully open_ (`Open=partiallyOpen` or `Open=fullyOpen`, respectively). By way of negation, such repository cannot be considered _closed_.

Conversely, when a repository imposes significant restrictions on accessing data it stores, it cannot be considered _fully open_. However, based on other aspects, it may be considered _partially open_.

## Dimensions

### Result Dimensions

Used for communicating results outside of the model.

* Open
* FAIR
* Citable
* Trustworthy
* Findable
* Accessible
* Interoperable
* Reusable

### Open

Dimensions affecting the `Open` dimension coordinate.
