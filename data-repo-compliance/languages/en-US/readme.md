# dkNET-Repository Compliance

Repositories are the publishers of scholarly objects within the commons.  We therefore view repositories as an essential piece of the commons by providing the means by which individual researchers can achieve commons compliance without having to understand all the intricacies of creating open, FAIR and citable objects.  To achieve this, the repository itself must trustworthy, that is, they must ensure the stability and persistence of objects within the commons and adhere themselves to the principles of the commons.  

This decision tree is developed in order to allow [dkNET](https://dknet.org/) to evaluate data repositories.dkNet is an information portal created to provide information to connect the NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Disease) community of researchers with scientific resources.

The decision tree is organized into 4 sections:  Open, FAIR, Citable and Trustworthy.  As you go through each section, an icon will appear in the Data Tags section indicating whether commons compliance has been achieved.
