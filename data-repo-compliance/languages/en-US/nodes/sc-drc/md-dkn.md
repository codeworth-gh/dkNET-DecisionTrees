### Does your repository accept metadata that is applicable to the dkNET community disciplines?

Biomedical repositories, in addition to the basic “Dublin Core” or ‘Schema.org” metadata, require certain fields to maximize utility as specified in dkNET’s rich metadata specification.  In addition, since dkNET is fostering an information network among the centers and data bases funded by NIDDK, we are expecting that they will include relevant connections to other dkNET listed resources.

#### Options
* **No:**  Only generic metadata is provided
* **For Datasets:**  Repository provides a plurality of biomedical specific attributes as part of their rich metadata.  It provides additional metadata as needed to interpret the study.
* **For Datasets & subjects:**  In addition to the dataset level metadata, the repository provides subject level metadata (ages, weights and sex of each subject rather pooled data).
