### Does the repository accept metadata that is applicable to the dkNET community disciplines?

Biomedical repositories, in addition to the basic [Dublin Core](https://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/) or [Schema.org](http://schema.org) metadata, require certain fields to maximize utility as specified in dkNET’s rich metadata specification. In addition, since dkNET is fostering an information network among the centers and data bases funded by NIDDK, we are expecting that they will include relevant connections to other dkNET listed resources.

#### Options
* **Best:** plurality. Subject level metadata (ages, weights and sex of each subject rather than pooled data).  
* **Good:** some basic biomedically relevant metadata
* **Worst:** only generic metadata is supplied
