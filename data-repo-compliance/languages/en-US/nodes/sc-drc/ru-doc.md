### Does the repository require or support documentation that aids in proper (re)-use of the data?

Vignettes or help that are designed not just for use of the repository, but that helps users understand the types of questions that can be answered by using the data and tools.  May be at the repository level for homogeneous data or at the data set level for heterogeneous data.  Repositories are expected to have basic help materials and tutorials.  We are asking for a level above that to fully achieve FAIR. not just how to perform certain functions but why you can use the resource to answer certain types of questions.

#### Options
* **best:**  Basic tutorials/help + accompanied by use cases or user stories at the  repository level and data set level if appropriate
* **good:**  Basic tutorials + encouragement and ability to add use cases even if not enforced
* **adequate:**  Tutorials but no use cases
* **worst:**  Inadequate tutorials + no use cases and no mention of them.
