### Does the repository use a recognized community standard for representing basic metadata?

There are good schemas now available for general purpose data set metadata, e.g., DataCite schema, Dublin Core, schema.org.  When a recognized schema is used, it promotes interoperability among data repositories and helps with data set search. Does the repository have supporting software and tools to enforce and take advantage of this standard, e.g., a validator.

#### Options
* **Yes:** When a recognized schema is mentioned.
* **No:** Otherwise.
