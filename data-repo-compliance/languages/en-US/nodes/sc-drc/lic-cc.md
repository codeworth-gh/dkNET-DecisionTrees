### Are the data covered by a commons-compliant license?

FAIR requires a clear license but it is mute about the level of openness;  the Commons requires that the data be as open as possible; closed as necessary. Is the license used consistent with that?  

In this question, we use the definition for "Open" from [https://opendefinition.org/licenses/](the Open Definition).


These licenses conform to the Open Definition but not to Re-Use
