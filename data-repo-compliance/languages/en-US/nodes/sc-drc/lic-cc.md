### Are the data covered by a commons-compliant license?

FAIR requires a clear license but it is mute about the level of openness;  the Commons requires that the data be as open as possible; closed as necessary. Is the license used consistent with that?  

#### Options
* **fully compliant:**
  * License is present and clearly indicated by a metadata tag.
  * License conforms to the requirements of the open definition;  will need to make a judgement about the “closed as necessary”, i.e., if it is human subject data that is subject to regulatory requirements, even if it is a more restrictive license, it may be OK.  
  * Single process to gain access to the entire repository
* **good:**  Clear licenses but multiple licenses permitted.  Use of multiple licenses across the repository (makes it harder to use). Example: PubMed Central is not universally available for text mining because content is covered under different licenses
* **adequate:**:  If no license is there, are there terms of use and are the  terms of use easy to understand and easy to access and understand (if you have to read through pages of legal requirements that is neither clear or easy to access)
* **inappropriate** License is there but inappropriate to support open as possible;  closed as necessary
* **none:**  No license or clear terms of use
