### Do the metadata use a formal accessible shared and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation?

The key concept here is “shared”. That is, two resources that use the same tags to mean the same thing, can be combined more easily than if they assign custom labels.  https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i1-metadata-use-formal-accessible-shared-broadly-applicable-language-knowledge-representation/  In assessing the repository, consider the hurdles that have to be cleared in order to use the data and metadata, in other words, what does the user have to struggle with before using the data?  Check formats, services provided and evaluate whether they conform with the principle.

> Humans should be able to exchange and interpret each other’s data (so preferably do not use dead languages). But this also applies to computers, meaning that data that should be readable for machines without the need for specialised or ad hoc algorithms, translators, or mappings. 

The RDF extensible knowledge representation model is a way to describe and structure datasets. The Dublin Core Schema is an example. Also includes: OWL, JSON LD, OPM (Open Provenance Model) and OntoDM (Ontology for Data Mining), EBI RDF Platform ontologies

#### Options

* **Yes:** if a formal, accessible language is explicitly listed.  Some common format (including Schema.org/microformats)
* **No:**  if no evidence of such a language can be found.
