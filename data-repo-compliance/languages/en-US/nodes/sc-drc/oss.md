### Is the code that runs the data infrastructure covered under an open source license?

Trust requires that the community feels in control and that the mission of the repository cannot be co-opted by a few stakeholders or controlling interests.  Therefore, [Bilder et al.](https://hyp.is/OpLLSh-6EeedBY-6rVxXRw/cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/) recommend that the code and content be "forkable", that is, all crucial parts, including data, code, legal agreements, can be replicated.  

From principles of open infrastructures.  If the repository violates the principles of community, could the repository be recreated by the community?  Some of them are and say so. Some things to look for:
* Is Code maintained in an open repository?
* Is the license for the code made clear?
* Is it an open license?

#### Options:
* **Best:**  Code maintained in an open code repository where it can be forked.  The license allows for reuse by 3rd parties.
* **Good:**  Code covered under an open license but not maintained in an open repository
* **No:**  No evidence of the above
