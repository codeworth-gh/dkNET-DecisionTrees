### Is the code that runs the data infrastructure covered under an open source license?

From the principles of open infrastructures.  If the repository violates the community principles, could the repository be recreated by the community?  Some of them are and say so. Some things to look for:

1. Is Code maintained in an open repository?
1. Is the license for the code made clear?
1. Is it an open license?


#### Options:
* **Best:**  Code maintained in an open code repository where it can be forked. The license allows for reuse by 3rd parties.
* **Good:**  Code covered under an open license but not maintained in an open repository
* **No:**  No evidence of the above
