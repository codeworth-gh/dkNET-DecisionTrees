### Does the repository support the addition of rich metadata to promote search and reuse of data?

We are interpreting rich metadata to include the basic descriptive information about the data set, i.e., those fields recommended by the DCIP, with the addition of critical biomedical metadata, e.g., organism studied, disease condition, technique.  dkNET has a recommended set of [rich metadata](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1fA2AJDvvmxlS8g8yvpnt6BIayvZVOR7dMYe-hWIiU/view). These data provide an overall context for understanding what the data set is about, but don’t necessarily delve into particulars.

#### Options

* **Rich:** the majority of DCIP fields + biomedical extensions according to dkNET or Bio Schema
* **Limited:** Has some structured metadata but room for improvement
* **Minimal:** Minimal descriptive information
