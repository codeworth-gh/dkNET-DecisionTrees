### Are the (meta)data associated with detailed provenance?

Is the appropriate provenance provided, e.g., if they use the Gene Ontology term do we know itâ€™s from gene ontology? In biomedicine, making sure that the relationship between subjects and specimens and data is explicit is extremely important.  RRIDs should be used to make sure that all data sets that use the same strain or sample can be found and combined.
Some aspects to look at:

* Does the repository provide originating information for the data set? Lab, PI, Institution.
* Do they provide a contact person? Does the contact person provide an ORCID?
* Do they use contributor roles so that we know who performed various actions?
* Do they provide an originating publication if applicable?
* Do they provide clear dates for submission and modification?
* Do the have a clear versioning policy?
* If they use external identifiers, are they accessible by their PIDs?  
* Do they make provenance of any externally imported or referenced data explicit in the (meta)data?

#### Options
* **best:**  Clear provenance where required + machine readable tag;  clear versioning policy and old versions can be accessed
* **good:**  Some good things, e.g., clear provenance provided in free text
* **worst:**  No clear provenance
