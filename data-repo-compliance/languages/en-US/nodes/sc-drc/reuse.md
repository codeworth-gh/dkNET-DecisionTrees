### Are you free to reuse the data with no or minimal restrictions?

Many repositories that claim to be open are only open for humans to read, *not for machine-based access* or *for re-use*. So it is important to check before depositing the data that it is free to re-use according to the definition of the Commons.

Data should be stored in a non-proprietary format, that is, a format that is published and free for re-use by anyone, such as CSV.  In contrast, proprietary formats can only be read by certain commercial software.  As the goal of publishing data in a repository is for openness and re-use, data reliant on propriety software is by definition non-commons compliant.  Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_format)

Consider the type of data and whether the access mechanism places undue restraints on the ability to re-use the data.  Also, consider the license that specifies 3rd party rights: does it allow the data to be re-used and -shared as part of a new product? 

Ideally, the repository should have a clear statement about acceptable file format characteristics.  In the absence of such a policy, a check can be made to ascertain which formats are available.  If there are both open and closed examples they are coded as “Yes with proprietary formats”.  If individual data sets are offered under multiple licenses, this can complicate the re-use process further.

#### Options
* **Yes:**  Permissive license or data use terms including the right to re-distribute products arising from the data;  open and well supported format
* **Somewhat:** Yes with proprietary formats, or with multiple licenses that require users to navigate the terms separately for each data set. A proprietary format that is still well used and has multiple tools that can read it, such as `xls`, is better than a custom format that is not well supported
* **No:**  A proprietary format that is difficult to read without the required software. Inability to distribute data products so that others may build on them. Terms of use are unclear.
