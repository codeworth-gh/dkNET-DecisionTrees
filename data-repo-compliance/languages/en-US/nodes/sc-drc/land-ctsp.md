### Does the machine-readable landing page support data citation?

Ideally, the above metadata (both descriptive and data citation relevant) should be able to be harvested automatically, e.g., by a citation manager.  We check this by:

1. Can you export landing page metadata in JSON or XML
1. Can you import the landing page metadata into a reference manager tool like Mendeley or Paperpile
1. If you look at the page source, do you see recognizable elements from [Dublin Core](https://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/) or [Schema.org](http://schema.org) in the markup metatags (Should be in the html head part).
