### Does the repository support bidirectional linkages between related objects such that a user accessing one object would know that there is a relationship to another object?

E.g., does the repository provide a linkage between the publication that first described the data and the data set;  does the repository maintain bidirectional linkages between versions,  if a dataset has multiple parts, each deposited in a different specialist repository, are the linkages clearly specified across all repositories.

#### Options
* **best:**  Repository not only records article provenance, but links that provenance to the PID such that a consumer of this metadata, e.g., DataCite, Crossref, Zenodo (OpenAIRE) or Scholix, can make use of this information
* **good:**  originating article is clearly indicated with an appropriate metadata tag (check landing page metadata)
* **unclear:**  publication is there but not indicated by a metadata tag, so the relationship between the data set and the publication is not clear (check landing page)
* **worst:**  No record of a publication (and no clear statement that there is no publication) (check landing page)
