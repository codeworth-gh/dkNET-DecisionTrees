### Does the repository provide the required metadata for supporting data citation?

The [Data Citation Implementation](https://www.force11.org/group/data-citation-implementation-group) and [Pilot Project groups](https://www.force11.org/group/dcip) at FORCE11 created a set of recommendations for how to cite data.  The repository should contain the relevant metadata:  authors (data creators), year, title of data, repository, unique identifier and version number.  For examples and more information, see [A Data Citation Primer](http://force11.github.io/data-citation-primer/authors/).

#### Options
* **Full support:**  The repository contains a metadata field with the full citation(s).
* **Partial Support:**  The repository has the required metadata elements but does not provide an easy way to cite the data. Required metadata should include all contributors just like with an article.
* **No Support:**  Insufficient metadata for a full citation, e.g., no title or authors.
