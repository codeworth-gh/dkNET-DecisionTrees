### Does the repository provide the required metadata for supporting data citation?

The repository should provide the necessary metadata for a full data citation according to the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles.  Authors, Title of data set, Version, Repository, Date published, PID. It should also be set up to enable exporting the citation reference via a reference manager (e.g. JSON, XML, Bibtex).

<!--
The [Data Citation Implementation](https://www.force11.org/group/data-citation-implementation-group) and [Pilot Project groups](https://www.force11.org/group/dcip) at FORCE11 created a set of recommendations for how to cite data.  The repository should contain the relevant metadata:  authors (data creators), year, title of data, repository, unique identifier and version number.  For examples and more information, see [A Data Citation Primer](http://force11.github.io/data-citation-primer/authors/).-->

#### Options
* **Full support:**  The repository contains a metadata field with the full citation(s).
* **Partial Support:**  The repository has the required metadata elements but does not provide an easy way to cite the data. Required metadata should include all contributors just like with an article.
* **No Support:**  Insufficient metadata for a full citation, e.g., no title or authors.
