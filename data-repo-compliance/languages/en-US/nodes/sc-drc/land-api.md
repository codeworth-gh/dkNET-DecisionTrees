### Does the repository provide a machine-readable landing page?

Ideally, the citation metadata (both descriptive and data citation relevant) should be able to be harvested automatically, e.g., by a citation manager.  We check this by:

1. Can you import the landing page metadata into a reference manager tool like Mendeley or Paperpile
1. If you look at the page source, do you see recognizable elements from Dublin Core or Schema.org in the mark up metatags (Should be in the html head part).

More on implementations of machine-readable metadata on dataset landing pages, see M. Fenner et al. _A data citation roadmap for scholarly data repositories_, Scientific Data, 2019. [doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0031-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0031-8).
