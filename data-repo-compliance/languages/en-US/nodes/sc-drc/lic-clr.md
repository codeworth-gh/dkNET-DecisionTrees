### Does the repository provide a clear license for reuse of the data?

Ideally, a metadata field `License=` or an easy to find statement on the web page stating the license under which data are released. The license should also ideally be one in common use where the usage rights are clearly stated and uncomplicated.

#### Options
* **Dataset Level:** Clear license and assigned at the level of individual data sets as part of the metadata
* **Repository Level:** Clear license provided at the level of the repository, e.g., all data are released under a CC-BY license
* **No license**
