### Do the metadata include qualified references to other (meta)data?

How well specified are the relationships included in the metadata, e.g. does the resource use the DataCite or some other schema/standard that specifies the relationship of an identifier to the data set, e.g., a PubMed ID for a publication that first reported the data set.  Should be machine friendly, e.g., ID’s for publications rather than free text.

e.g:  A data repository provides information on who created the data set and related publications  

#### Options

* **best:** The relationship between the data set or element and an identifier that references an external entity is clearly specified, e.g., the people listed and the related publication are clearly specified
   * Data publication:  DOI or PMID
   * Author:  ORCID + metadata
   * Contact person: ORCID + appropriate metadata
* **good:** Identifiers provided but no explicit relationships given
  * Publication:  Tagged but doesn’t specify the relationship of the publication to the data set clearly
  * Creators:  Tagged but doesn’t specify key roles clearly
* **worst:** Authors and publication are provided in free text
