### Does the repository assign globally unique and persistent identifiers (PIDs)?

A globally unique and persistent identifier is one of the key pillars of FAIR data.  If a data set can't be found reliably, i.e., it does not have a stable address that is machine-readable, then it can't be accessible, interoperable or reusable to anyone else.  A repository should assign a globally unique and resolvable identifier, e.g., a DOI, to a data set.  Many data repositories assign locally unique identifiers, e.g., accession numbers like 5639.  These can be turned into globally unique identifiers, e.g., by adding a URL prefix.  The repository should also ensure that the identifier is persistent-that is, it is never re-assigned to another entity, even if the underlying data are removed, and the repository must stand behind its resolution, ensuring that the identifier reliably resolves to the data, even if the data move location.  For a more detailed description of identifiers, see [The FAIR Principles Explained](https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/fair-principles-explained/) by the Dutch Techcenter for Life Sciences.

Answer is yes if this is the default option, i.e., an externally linked and registered PID, e.g., a DOI, Handle, ARK. Sometimes Accession numbers are offered as standard. These can be easily upgraded to PIDs through the Compact Identifiers functionality but unless this is specified on the website, the response is ‘No’.
