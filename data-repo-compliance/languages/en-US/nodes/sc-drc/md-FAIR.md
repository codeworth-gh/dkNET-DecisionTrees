### Do the metadata use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles?

Use of a community ontology, e.g., OBO, or a controlled vocabulary that follows FAIR principles in order to facilitate combining data from one repository with another.

#### Options

* **enforced:** Required mapping to appropriate FAIR community ontologies widely used in biomedicine and vocabularies where possible and clear documentation
* **allowed:** Allowed use of identifiers in the metadata scheme although not necessarily enforced; use of some identifiers but lack of mapping in some areas where it would be possible
* **minimal:** Minimal or no mapping to appropriate ontologies
