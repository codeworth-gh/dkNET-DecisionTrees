### Is the repository stakeholder governed?

Does the repository make it clear how the community participates in the decision making process for the repository.
Should have a listing of the board and evidence that they meet regularly, e.g. minutes, reports, etc.

We adapt here some of the principles for open infrastructures laid out by Bilder G, Lin J, Neylon C (2015) [Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructure](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314859).  One of the most important is that the repository is [stakeholder governed](https://hyp.is/_X3W4h-4EeeCpm8NXWVZGg/cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).  

#### Options:

* **Full:**  Repository is governed by the research community through a clear governance process
* **Good:**  Repository is run by an individual or company but has a strong scientific advisory board that has power to influence decisions.  
* **Weak:**  Clearly run by NIH/researchers for researchers but not really governed as a community resource
* **No:**  No accountability to the scientific community and no means of input
