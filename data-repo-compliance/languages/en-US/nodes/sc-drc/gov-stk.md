### Is the repository stakeholder governed?

Repositories play a critical role in the commons, as they are the publishers of scholarly objects.  but how do we determine whether a repository is a trustworthy publisher, that is, that they will adhere to the [principles of the commons](https://www.force11.org/scholarly-commons/principles)? We adapt here some of the principles for open infrastructures laid out by Bilder G, Lin J, Neylon C (2015) [Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructure](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314859).  One of the most important is that the repository is [stakeholder governed](https://hyp.is/_X3W4h-4EeeCpm8NXWVZGg/cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).  In this way, the repository can be responsive to the commons community.  

#### Options:

* **Full:**  Repository is governed by the research community through a clear governance process
* **Good:**  Repository is run by an individual or company but has a strong scientific advisory board that has power to influence decisions.  
* **Weak:**  Clearly run by NIH/researchers for researchers but not really governed as a community resource
* **No:**  No accountability to the scientific community and no means of input
