### Is the governance of the repository transparent?

In general, the operations of a repository, including the selection of an advisory board, should be [transparent](https://hyp.is/Ionpxh-5EeeELfNgkgoC8w/cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).  

Evidence of how decisions are made that affect the repositoryâ€™s scope or direction, e.g.,  Is there an Advisory Board? how are advisory members chosen, what are their terms, how are decisions made on behalf of the repository?  Is it one person?  Is there a voting system?  Do we know who runs the repository?

#### Options:

* **Best:**  Clear and up to date information
* **Good:**  Some information but perhaps difficult to find, not exactly clear or up to date
* **Worst:**  No information at all
