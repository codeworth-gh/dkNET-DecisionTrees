### Does the metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes?


Should have a metadata field = data set  identifier or equivalent that points to the PID or other identifier if no PID  SOmetimes it is useful to check the API services if documented about what they provide.

#### Options:

* **all**: All study IDs are included in the metadata
* **some**: Some study IDs are included, e.g., accession number but not DOI
* **none**: No IDs
