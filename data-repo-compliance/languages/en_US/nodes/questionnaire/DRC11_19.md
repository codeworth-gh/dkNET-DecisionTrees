Are you free to download the data and reuse it with no or minimal restrictions?

Many repositories that claim to be open are only open for humans to read, *not for machine-based access or for re-use*. So it is important to check before depositing data that the data is free to reuse according to the definition of the commons.

Data should be stored in a non-proprietary format, i.e., a format that is published and free for re-use by anyone, e.g., CSV.  In contrast, a proprietary format is not published and can only be read by certain commercial software.  As the goal of publishing data in a repository is for openness and re-use, data that is reliant on propriety software is by definition non-commons compliant.
