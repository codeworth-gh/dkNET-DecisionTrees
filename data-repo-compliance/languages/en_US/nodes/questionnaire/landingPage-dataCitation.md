### Does the machine-readable landing page supports data citation?

Ideally, the above metadata (both descriptive and data citation relevant) should be able to be harvested automatically, e.g., by a citation manager.  We check this by:

1. Can you export landing page metadata in JSON or XML
1. Can you import the landing page metadata into a reference manager tool like Mendeley or Paperpile
1. If you look at the page source, do you see recognizable elements from Dublin Core or Schema.org in the mark up metatags (Should be in the html head part).
