Is the repository stakeholder governed?

Repositories play a critical role in the commons, as they are the publishers of scholarly objects.  but how do we determine whether a repository is a trustworthy publisher, that is, that they will adhere to the [principles of the commons](https://www.force11.org/scholarly-commons/principles)? We adapt here some of the principles for open infrastructures laid out by Bilder G, Lin J, Neylon C (2015) [Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructure](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314859).  One of the most important is that the repository is [stakeholder governed](https://hyp.is/_X3W4h-4EeeCpm8NXWVZGg/cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).  In this way, the repository can be responsive to the commons community.
