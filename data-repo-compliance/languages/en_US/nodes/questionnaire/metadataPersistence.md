### Does the repository have a policy that ensures the metadata (landing page) will persist even if the data are no longer available?

Is there evidence that metadata persists even when the data are no longer available.  Ideally, repositories clearly state their accessioning and de-accessioning policies as per the data citation principles.

#### Terms

* **by policy:** a clear persistence policy
* **by evidence:** evidence that dataset metadata is persisted when its dataset becomes unavailable  (e.g., landing page makes it clear that a data set is no longer available)
* **unknown:** No policy stated and no evidence.
