# Force11-Repository Compliance

__Version 0.2__

Repositories are the publishers of scholarly objects within the commons.  We therefore view repositories as an essential piece of the commons by providing the means by which individual researchers can achieve commons compliance without having to understand all the intricacies of creating open, FAIR and citable objects.  To achieve this, the repository itself must trustworthy, that is, they must ensure the stability and persistence of objects within the commons and adhere themselves to the principles of the commons.  

This decision tree provides guidance on selecting a data repository that supports the principles of the commons by making objects within the commons [open](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tX_ZFTKWPQmejS0uxdXf_PajZbcYWUrlDaAOBBo2vc/edit), [FAIR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZYWfXXETE0i5U-DTkfxtzUitKU8OfMybiNdKdmE6uk/edit#heading=h.b49fd0lpbtqd) and [citable](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2c99JAI9phb5ZX8nexNeXfBasFU0flMDyA2eK8nF8U/edit#), and provides guidance on evaluating the trustworthiness of the repository.  As always with our decision trees, this tree is designed to give practical guidance on making decisions about where to trust your data, profile, etc, not to say one repository is either good or bad.
