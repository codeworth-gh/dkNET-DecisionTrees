# Slots in Translation
Michael Bar-Sinai, Fiona Murphy, Maryann E. Martone

This document describes how the _low-level slots_ in our model affect its _high-level slots_. Low-level slots describe how an evaluated repository is performing on a narrow aspect, such as its compliance with Creative Commons licenses or the way it allows dataset authors to be associated with https://orcid.org/[ORCID]. High-level slots describe wide properties such as "Openness" or "Interoperability". Their value is a summary of values in relevant low-level slots.

## How to Read This Document

Below, we list slot names on the left, and their possible values on the right. For each value, we describe what constraints it imposes on the high-level slot that summarizes it. As an example, in the following listing we look at the constraints values in the `Restrictions` slot impose on the values that may be stored in the `Open` slot.

[horizontal]
Restrictions::
    * none        => Open in `partially..fully`
    * minimal     => Open is `partially`
    * significant => Open in `not..partially`

Based on the above listing, we see that when an a repository does not restrict the access to its data (i.e. `Restrictions=none`), said repository can be considered _partially open_ or _fully open_ (`Open=partiallyOpen` or `Open=fullyOpen`, respectively). By way of negation, such repository cannot be considered _closed_.

Conversely, when a repository imposes significant restriction on accessing data it stores, it cannot be considered _fully open_. However, based on other aspects, it may be considered _partially open_.

[NOTE]
Not all slots defined by our model appear here -- this document does not describe "compound slots", which are used to group other slots. E.g. `OpenProps` groups `Restrictions`, `CCLicenseCompliance`, and `OpenFlags`. As such, these slots serve as an organization aid, and do not have a value of their own. Thus, we do not need to discuss them here.
