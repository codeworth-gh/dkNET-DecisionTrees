# Slots in Translation

[TODO]
Get some proper explanation of this document.

Slots not appearing here are "compound slots", that are used to group other slots. E.g. `OpenProps` groups `Restrictions`, `CCLicenseCompliance`, and `OpenFlags`. As such, these slots do not have a value of their own, and thus we do not need to discuss them here.
